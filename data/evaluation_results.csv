GPT4OMiniModel,643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. Problem: 
Given a circle with center \( O \) and diameter \( CD \). Chord \( DE \) is parallel to \( OA \). If the measure of \( \angle D \) is \( 50^\circ \), find the measure of \( \angle C \).

2. Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to use properties of circles and parallel lines.

- Since \( CD \) is the diameter, \( \angle CED \) is a right angle (90 degrees) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is a right angle.
- Given that \( DE \parallel OA \), the corresponding angles formed by the parallel lines and the transversal \( CD \) are equal. Therefore, \( \angle CDE = \angle OAD \).
- Since \( \angle D \) is given as \( 50^\circ \), and \( \angle CDE \) is the same as \( \angle OAD \), we have \( \angle CDE = 50^\circ \).

Now, consider triangle \( CDE \):
- The sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
- We know \( \angle CED = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle CDE = 50^\circ \).

Thus, we can find \( \angle C \) as follows:
\[ \angle C = 180^\circ - \angle CED - \angle CDE \]
\[ \angle C = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 50^\circ \]
\[ \angle C = 40^\circ \]

3. Answer:
The measure of \( \angle C \) is \( 40^\circ \).",0,5.690961837768555,375,358
GPT4OMiniModel,665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"1. **Problem:**
   Find the length \( h \) in the right triangle where one of the angles is \( 60^\circ \) and the side opposite this angle is 4 units.

2. **Solution:**
   In a right triangle, the relationship between the sides and angles can be described using trigonometric functions. For the given triangle, we can use the sine function, which is defined as:
   \[
   \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]
   Here, \(\theta = 60^\circ\), the opposite side is 4, and the hypotenuse is \( h \).

   Using the sine function:
   \[
   \sin(60^\circ) = \frac{4}{h}
   \]

   We know that \(\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{4}{h}
   \]

   To solve for \( h \), we can cross-multiply:
   \[
   \sqrt{3} \cdot h = 4 \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{3} \cdot h = 8
   \]

   Now, divide both sides by \(\sqrt{3}\):
   \[
   h = \frac{8}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]

   To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{3}\):
   \[
   h = \frac{8 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3}} = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{3}
   \]

3. **Answer:**
   \[
   h = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{3}

GPT4OMiniModel,887,"As shown in the figure, △ABC is the inscribed triangle of ⊙O. If ∠ABC = 70.0, then the degree of ∠AOC is equal to ()",140°,"1. **Problem:**
   Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an inscribed triangle in circle \( \odot O \) and \( \angle ABC = 70^\circ \), find the measure of \( \angle AOC \).

2. **Solution:**
   To find \( \angle AOC \), we can use the property of inscribed angles and central angles in a circle.

   - An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
   - In this case, \( \angle ABC \) is an inscribed angle that subtends arc \( AC \).
   - The central angle \( \angle AOC \) subtends the same arc \( AC \).

   Therefore, the measure of the central angle \( \angle AOC \) is twice the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle ABC \).

   \[
   \angle AOC = 2 \times \angle ABC
   \]

   Given \( \angle ABC = 70^\circ \):

   \[
   \angle AOC = 2 \times 70^\circ = 140^\circ
   \]

   Find the area of the trapezoid with the given dimensions: the lengths of the parallel sides are 41 ft and 53 ft, and the height is 48 ft.

2. **Solution:**
   The area \( A \) of a trapezoid can be found using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
   \]
   where \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \( h \) is the height.

   Given:
   \[
   b_1 = 41 \text{ ft}, \quad b_2 = 53 \text{ ft}, \quad h = 48 \text{ ft}

GPT4OMiniModel,610,"In the figure above, P, Q, and R lie on the same line. P is the center of the larger circle, and Q is the center of the smaller circle. If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"1. **Problem:**
   Determine the radius of the smaller circle given that:
   - \( P \) is the center of the larger circle.
   - \( Q \) is the center of the smaller circle.
   - \( P \), \( Q \), and \( R \) lie on the same line.
   - The radius of the larger circle is 4.

2. **Solution:**
   - Let the radius of the smaller circle be \( r \).
   - Since \( P \) is the center of the larger circle and its radius is 4, the distance from \( P \) to any point on the circumference of the larger circle is 4.
   - \( Q \) is the center of the smaller circle, and the smaller circle is tangent to the larger circle at point \( R \).
   - The distance from \( P \) to \( Q \) is the sum of the radii of the two circles because the circles are tangent to each other at \( R \).

   Therefore, the distance \( PQ \) is:
   \[
   PQ = 4 + r
   \]

   Since \( Q \) is the center of the smaller circle and \( R \) is a point on the circumference of the smaller circle, the distance \( QR \) is equal to the radius of the smaller circle \( r \).

   Given that \( P \), \( Q \), and \( R \) lie on the same line, the total distance \( PR \) is the sum of \( PQ \) and \( QR \):
   \[
   PR = PQ + QR = (4 + r) + r = 4 + 2r
   \]

   However, \( PR \) is also the radius of the larger circle, which is 4. Therefore:
   \[
   4 + 2r = 4
   \]

   Solving for \( r \):
   \[
   4 + 2r = 4
   \]
   \[
   2r = 0
   \]
   \[
   r = 0
   \]

   This result is not possible because the radius of a circle cannot be zero. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

   Since the smaller circle is inside the larger circle and tangent to it, the correct interpretation is that the distance from \( P \) to \( Q \) is the difference in the radii of the two circles:
   \[
   PQ = 4 - r
   \]

   Given that \( QR = r \) and \( PR = 4 \):
   \[
   PR = PQ + QR = (4 - r) + r = 4
   \]

   This equation is always true and does not help us find \( r \). Therefore, we need to use the fact that the smaller circle is tangent to the larger circle at \( R \), meaning the distance from \( P \) to \( Q \) is exactly the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller circle:
   \[
   PQ = 4 - r
   \]

   Since \( PQ \) is the distance between the centers of the two circles and must be equal to the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller circle, we have:
   \[
   4 - r = r
   \]

   Solving for \( r \):
   \[
   4 = 2r
   \]
   \[
   r = 2
   \]

3. **Answer:**
   The radius of the smaller circle is \( \boxed{2} \).",1,13.111717939376831,387,758
GPT4OMiniModel,198,Calculate the missing value.,1,"1. Problem: Determine the missing value in the black triangle, given the patterns in the other triangles.

2. Solution: Let's analyze the given triangles to identify a pattern.

- Blue Triangle: 6, 2, 2
- Green Triangle: 4, 1, 3
- Purple Triangle: 3, 2, 5

We need to find a relationship between the numbers in each triangle.

Let's look at the sum of the numbers in each triangle:
- Blue Triangle: 6 + 2 + 2 = 10
- Green Triangle: 4 + 1 + 3 = 8
- Purple Triangle: 3 + 2 + 5 = 10

It seems that the sum of the numbers in each triangle is either 10 or 8. 

Now, let's consider the black triangle:
- Black Triangle: 1, 0, ?

We need to find the missing number such that the sum of the numbers in the black triangle is either 10 or 8.

If the sum is 10:
1 + 0 + ? = 10
1 + 0 + ? = 10
? = 10 - 1
? = 9

If the sum is 8:
1 + 0 + ? = 8
1 + 0 + ? = 8
? = 8 - 1
? = 7

Since the sum of the numbers in the other triangles is either 10 or 8, the missing number in the black triangle could be either 9 or 7. However, given the pattern of the sums being 10 or 8, and considering the simplicity of the numbers used, 7 seems more likely.

2. Solution:
   - Since AB and CD intersect at point O, they form four angles around point O.
   - ∠AOD and ∠BOC are vertically opposite angles, so they are equal. Therefore, ∠BOC = ∠AOD = 70°.
   - Ray OE bisects ∠BOC, which means it divides ∠BOC into two equal parts.
   - Therefore, each part of ∠BOC is (70° / 2) = 35°.
   - ∠AOE is one of these parts, so ∠AOE = 35°.

In a 4×4 square grid where each small square has a side length of 1, points A, B, and C are on the grid points. AD is perpendicular to BC at point D. Find the length of AD.

2. Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the coordinates of points A, B, and C, and then use the properties of perpendicular lines and distance formulas.

Let's assume the coordinates of the points are as follows:
- \( A = (x_1, y_1) \)
- \( B = (x_2, y_2) \)
- \( C = (x_3, y_3) \)

From the grid, we can see:
- \( A = (2, 4) \)
- \( B = (0, 0) \)
- \( C = (4, 2) \)

The line BC can be represented by the equation of a line. The slope of BC is:
\[ \text{slope of } BC = \frac{y_3 - y_2}{x_3 - x_2} = \frac{2 - 0}{4 - 0} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The equation of line BC in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) is:
\[ y = \frac{1}{2}x \]

Since AD is perpendicular to BC, the slope of AD is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC:
\[ \text{slope of } AD = -2 \]

The equation of line AD passing through point A (2, 4) is:
\[ y - 4 = -2(x - 2) \]
\[ y - 4 = -2x + 4 \]
\[ y = -2x + 8 \]

To find the coordinates of point D, we need to find the intersection of the lines \( y = \frac{1}{2}x \) and \( y = -2x + 8 \).

Set the equations equal to each other:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x = -2x + 8 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 8 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 8 \]
\[ x = \frac{16}{5} \]

Substitute \( x = \frac{16}{5} \) back into the equation \( y = \frac{1}{2}x \):
\[ y = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{16}{5} = \frac{8}{5} \]

So, the coordinates of point D are \( \left( \frac{16}{5}, \frac{8}{5} \right) \).

Now, we calculate the distance AD using the distance formula:
\[ AD = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_D)^2 + (y_1 - y_D)^2} \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{\left( 2 - \frac{16}{5} \right)^2 + \left( 4 - \frac{8}{5} \right)^2} \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{\left( \frac{10}{5} - \frac{16}{5} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{20}{5} - \frac{8}{5} \right)^2} \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{\left( \frac{-6}{5} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{12}{5} \right)^2} \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{\frac{36}{25} + \frac{144}{25}} \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{\frac{180}{25}} \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{7.2} \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{7.2} \approx 2.68 \]

The length of AD is approximately 2.68 units.",0,10.475301027297974,381,840

   Given that PA and PB are tangents to circle O from point P, and PA = 8.0. Points C and D are on line segments PA and PB respectively, and CD is tangent to circle O. We need to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

2. **Solution:**
   - Since PA and PB are tangents from point P to circle O, PA = PB = 8.0.
   - Tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
   - Let E be the point of tangency of CD with circle O.
   - Since CD is tangent to circle O at point E, and C and D are on PA and PB respectively, we have:
     - PC = PA - CA
     - PD = PB - DB
   - Since PA = PB, and CA = DB (because tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal), we have:
     - PC = PD = PA - CA = PB - DB
   - Let CA = DB = x. Then:
     - PC = PD = 8.0 - x
   - The length of CD is constant because it is tangent to the circle at point E.

   To find the perimeter of triangle PCD:
   - Perimeter of △PCD = PC + PD + CD
   - Since PC = PD, we have:
     - Perimeter of △PCD = 2 * PC + CD
   - Substituting PC = 8.0 - x:
     - Perimeter of △PCD = 2 * (8.0 - x) + CD

   Since CD is tangent to the circle and does not change as C and D move along PA and PB, we need to find the length of CD. However, without additional information about the specific positions of C and D or the radius of the circle, we cannot determine the exact length of CD.

   Given the problem constraints and the information provided, we assume that CD is a constant length. For simplicity, let's denote the length of CD as L.

   Therefore, the perimeter of △PCD is:
   - Perimeter of △PCD = 2 * (8.0 - x) + L

Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with point \( D \) inside the triangle such that \( CD \) bisects \( \angle ACB \), \( BD \perp CD \), and \( \angle A = \angle ABD \). If \( \angle DBC = 54^\circ \), find the measure of \( \angle A \).

2. Solution:
Let's denote the angles as follows:
- \( \angle A = x \)
- \( \angle ABD = x \)
- \( \angle DBC = 54^\circ \)

Since \( CD \) bisects \( \angle ACB \), we have:
\[ \angle ACD = \angle BCD \]

Since \( BD \perp CD \), \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \).

In \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \angle DBC + \angle BDC + \angle BCD = 180^\circ \]
\[ 54^\circ + 90^\circ + \angle BCD = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle BCD = 36^\circ \]

Since \( CD \) bisects \( \angle ACB \), we have:
\[ \angle ACB = 2 \times \angle BCD = 2 \times 36^\circ = 72^\circ \]

In \( \triangle ABC \):
\[ \angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ \]
\[ x + \angle ABC + 72^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle ABC = 108^\circ - x \]

In \( \triangle ABD \):
\[ \angle ABD = x \]
\[ \angle DBC = 54^\circ \]
\[ \angle ABC = \angle ABD + \angle DBC \]
\[ 108^\circ - x = x + 54^\circ \]
\[ 108^\circ - 54^\circ = 2x \]
\[ 54^\circ = 2x \]
\[ x = 27^\circ \]

The measure of \( \angle A \) is \( 27^\circ \).",1,7.299274921417236,379,454

Given that \( AD \) is the median of \( \triangle ABC \), and \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AD \). The area of \( \triangle ABE \) is 2. Find the area of \( \triangle ABC \).

2. Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of medians and the areas of triangles.

- Since \( AD \) is the median, it divides \( \triangle ABC \) into two smaller triangles \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \) of equal area.
- Since \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AD \), \( E \) divides \( AD \) into two equal segments, making \( AE = ED \).

Given that the area of \( \triangle ABE \) is 2, we can use the fact that \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AD \) to determine the area of \( \triangle ABD \).

- The area of \( \triangle ABE \) is half of the area of \( \triangle ABD \) because \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AD \). Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ABD \) is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \).

Since \( AD \) is the median, the area of \( \triangle ABD \) is equal to the area of \( \triangle ACD \).

- Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is also 4.

Finally, the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is the sum of the areas of \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \).

3. Answer:
The area of \( \triangle ABC \) is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).",1,6.031764984130859,362,367
GPT4OMiniModel,160,Find x.,12,"1. Problem: 
Find the length of side \( x \) in the right triangle with the other two sides measuring 9 and 15.

2. Solution:
To find the length of the unknown side in a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states:
\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]
where \( c \) is the hypotenuse (the longest side), and \( a \) and \( b \) are the other two sides.

In this triangle, the hypotenuse is 15, and the other side is 9. We need to find \( x \).

\[ x^2 + 9^2 = 15^2 \]

First, calculate \( 9^2 \) and \( 15^2 \):
\[ 9^2 = 81 \]
\[ 15^2 = 225 \]

Now substitute these values into the equation:
\[ x^2 + 81 = 225 \]

Subtract 81 from both sides to solve for \( x^2 \):
\[ x^2 = 225 - 81 \]
\[ x^2 = 144 \]

Take the square root of both sides to find \( x \):
\[ x = \sqrt{144} \]
\[ x = 12 \]

The length of side \( x \) is 12.",1,6.491678953170776,334,289

   Find the scale factor from \( Q \) to \( Q' \).

2. **Solution:**
   To find the scale factor from \( Q \) to \( Q' \), we need to determine the ratio of the distances from point \( C \) to \( Q \) and from point \( C \) to \( Q' \).

   - The distance from \( C \) to \( Q \) is given as 5 units.
   - The total distance from \( C \) to \( Q' \) is the sum of the distances from \( C \) to \( Q \) and from \( Q \) to \( Q' \). This is \( 5 + 15 = 20 \) units.

GPT4OMiniModel,776,Find $JQ$ if $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$.  Rounded to the nearest hundredth.,18.79,"To find \( JQ \), we need to use the properties of the incenter and the given information. The incenter \( Q \) is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect, and it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.

Given:
- \( Q \) is the incenter of \( \triangle JLN \).
- \( Q \) is equidistant from \( JL \), \( LN \), and \( NJ \).
- \( QM = 9 \) (distance from \( Q \) to \( LN \)).
- \( JP = 16.5 \) (distance from \( J \) to \( P \)).

Since \( Q \) is the incenter, the distances from \( Q \) to the sides of the triangle are equal. Therefore, \( QP = QM = 9 \).

We can use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle JQP \) to find \( JQ \):

\[
JQ^2 = JP^2 + QP^2
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
JQ^2 = 16.5^2 + 9^2
\]

Calculating the squares:

\[
16.5^2 = 272.25
\]
\[
9^2 = 81
\]

Adding these values:

\[
JQ^2 = 272.25 + 81 = 353.25

Taking the square root to find \( JQ \):

\[
JQ = \sqrt{353.25} \approx 18.80

   - 首先，利用角平分线定理，\(\angle ABC\) 的平分线交 \(AD\) 于点 \(E\)，则有：
     \[
     \frac{AE}{ED} = \frac{AB}{BC}
     \]
     由于 \(ABCD\) 是平行四边形，\(AB = CD\)，所以 \(BC = AB = 3\)。因此：
     \[
     \frac{AE}{ED} = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \implies AE = ED
     \]
     因为 \(AD = 4\)，所以 \(AE = ED = 2\)。

   - 同理，\(\angle BCD\) 的平分线交 \(AD\) 于点 \(F\)，则有：

     因为 \(AD = 4\)，所以 \(AF = FD = 2\)。

   - 由于 \(E\) 和 \(F\) 分别将 \(AD\) 平分为两段相等的部分，所以 \(E\) 和 \(F\) 实际上是同一个点，即 \(E = F\)。

   Given that straight lines AB and CD intersect at point O, OD bisects ∠AOE, and ∠BOC = 50.0°, find the measure of ∠EOB.

   - Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.
   - Let ∠AOD = ∠DOE = x.
   - Since AB and CD are straight lines intersecting at O, the angles around point O must sum to 360°.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB + ∠BOC = 360°
     \]
   - Substituting the known values and the expressions for the angles, we get:
     \[
     x + x + ∠EOB + 50° = 360°
     \]
   - Simplifying, we have:
     \[
     2x + ∠EOB + 50° = 360°
     \]
   - Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOE = 2x.
   - Also, ∠AOE and ∠BOC are supplementary because they are on a straight line (AB), so:
     \[
     ∠AOE + ∠BOC = 180°
     \]
   - Substituting the known value of ∠BOC, we get:
     \[
     2x + 50° = 180°
     \]
   - Solving for x, we have:
     \[
     2x = 180° - 50°
     \]
     \[
     2x = 130°
     \]
     \[
     x = 65°
     \]
   - Now, substituting x back into the equation for the sum of the angles around point O:
     \[
     2(65°) + ∠EOB + 50° = 360°
     \]
     \[
     130° + ∠EOB + 50° = 360°
     \]
     \[
     180° + ∠EOB = 360°
     \]
     \[
     ∠EOB = 360° - 180°
     \]
     \[
     ∠EOB = 180°

GPT4OMiniModel,489,"For trapezoid ABCD shown above, AB = 24, AD = 23, and BC = 16. What is the length of segment CD?",25,"1. **Problem:**
   Determine the length of segment \( CD \) in trapezoid \( ABCD \) where \( AB = 24 \), \( AD = 23 \), and \( BC = 16 \).

2. **Solution:**
   To find the length of \( CD \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by dropping perpendiculars from \( B \) and \( C \) to \( AD \).

   Let's denote the foot of the perpendicular from \( B \) to \( AD \) as \( E \) and the foot of the perpendicular from \( C \) to \( AD \) as \( F \).

   Since \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular to \( AD \), \( AE = AB = 24 \) and \( CF = BC = 16 \).

   The length of \( AD \) is given as 23. We need to find the length of \( EF \), which is the horizontal distance between \( E \) and \( F \).

   Since \( AE \) and \( CF \) are both perpendicular to \( AD \), \( E \) and \( F \) lie on the same horizontal line. Therefore, the length of \( EF \) is the difference between the lengths of \( AE \) and \( CF \).

   \[
   EF = AE - CF = 24 - 16 = 8
   \]

   Now, we need to find the length of \( CD \). Since \( CD \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( CDF \) with legs \( CF \) and \( EF \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:

   \[
   CD = \sqrt{CF^2 + EF^2} = \sqrt{16^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{256 + 64} = \sqrt{320} = 8\sqrt{5}

   Given a circle \(\odot O\) with a point \(P\) outside the circle. The lines \(PA\) and \(PB\) intersect the circle at points \(C\) and \(D\) respectively. The central angles subtended by arcs \(AB\) and \(CD\) are \(90^\circ\) and \(50^\circ\) respectively. Find the measure of \(\angle P\).

2. **Solution:**
   To find \(\angle P\), we need to use the properties of the circle and the given central angles.

   - The central angle subtended by arc \(AB\) is \(90^\circ\). Therefore, the measure of arc \(AB\) is \(90^\circ\).
   - The central angle subtended by arc \(CD\) is \(50^\circ\). Therefore, the measure of arc \(CD\) is \(50^\circ\).

   Since \(P\) is outside the circle and \(PA\) and \(PB\) intersect the circle at points \(C\) and \(D\), we can use the fact that the measure of the angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

   The intercepted arcs are \(AB\) and \(CD\). The measure of the angle formed by the secants \(PA\) and \(PB\) is given by:
   \[
   \angle P = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{measure of arc } AB - \text{measure of arc } CD \right)

   Find the length of a side of a square inscribed in a circle with an area of \(18\pi\) square units.

2. **Solution:**
   - First, determine the radius of the circle.
     The area of the circle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \pi r^2
     \]
     Given that the area is \(18\pi\) square units, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \pi r^2 = 18\pi
     \]
     Dividing both sides by \(\pi\):
     \[
     r^2 = 18
     \]
     Taking the square root of both sides:
     \[
     r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
     \]

   - Next, relate the radius of the circle to the side length of the inscribed square.
     The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. The diameter \(d\) is twice the radius:

Given a circle with center \( O \) and diameter \( AB \). \( CD \) is a chord of the circle, and \( \angle ADC = 26^\circ \). Find the measure of \( \angle CAB \).

2. Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of circles and angles subtended by chords and diameters.

- Since \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle, \( \angle ADB \) is a right angle (90 degrees) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is always a right angle.

- Given \( \angle ADC = 26^\circ \), we can find \( \angle ADB \) as follows:
  \[
  \angle ADB = 90^\circ
  \]

- In the cyclic quadrilateral \( ACBD \), the opposite angles sum up to \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle ADC + \angle CAB = 180^\circ \).

- Since \( \angle ADC = 26^\circ \), we can find \( \angle CAB \) by subtracting \( \angle ADC \) from \( 90^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle CAB = 90^\circ - \angle ADC
  \]
  \[
  \angle CAB = 90^\circ - 26^\circ

   Given a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) inscribed in a circle with center \(O\), and \(\angle O = 110^\circ\), find the measure of \(\angle C\).

2. **Solution:**
   To solve this problem, we need to use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the central angle theorem.

   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to \(180^\circ\).
   - The central angle \(\angle O\) subtended by an arc is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.

   Given:
   \[
   \angle O = 110^\circ

   Since \(\angle O\) is the central angle subtended by arc \(AB\), the inscribed angle \(\angle ACB\) subtended by the same arc \(AB\) is:
   \[
   \angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle O = \frac{1}{2} \times 110^\circ = 55^\circ

Given that \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(BC \parallel DE\), with \(\angle A = 45^\circ\) and \(\angle C = 110^\circ\), find the measure of \(\angle AED\).

2. Solution:
To find \(\angle AED\), we can use the properties of parallel lines and the sum of angles in a triangle.

Since \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(BC \parallel DE\), we can use the properties of alternate interior angles and corresponding angles.

First, note that:
\[
\angle C = 110^\circ
\]

Since \(BC \parallel DE\), \(\angle C\) and \(\angle EDC\) are alternate interior angles, so:
\[
\angle EDC = 110^\circ
\]

Next, consider triangle \(AED\). The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
\[
\angle A + \angle AED + \angle EDC = 180^\circ
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
45^\circ + \angle AED + 110^\circ = 180^\circ
\]

Combine the known angles:
\[
155^\circ + \angle AED = 180^\circ

In triangle \( \triangle ABC \), point \( D \) is on \( BC \) such that \( BD = 2 \) and \( DC = 1 \). The area of \( \triangle ACD \) is 12. Find the area of \( \triangle ABC \).

2. Solution:
To find the area of \( \triangle ABC \), we can use the fact that the area of a triangle is proportional to the lengths of its sides when they share the same height.

Given:
- \( BD = 2 \)
- \( DC = 1 \)
- \( S_{\triangle ACD} = 12 \)

First, calculate the ratio of \( BD \) to \( DC \):
\[ \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{2}{1} = 2 \]

Since \( D \) divides \( BC \) into segments \( BD \) and \( DC \) with a ratio of 2:1, the area of \( \triangle ABD \) will be twice the area of \( \triangle ACD \) because they share the same height from \( A \) to \( BC \).

Let \( S_{\triangle ABD} \) be the area of \( \triangle ABD \). Then:
\[ S_{\triangle ABD} = 2 \times S_{\triangle ACD} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, the total area of \( \triangle ABC \) is the sum of the areas of \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \):
\[ S_{\triangle ABC} = S_{\triangle ABD} + S_{\triangle ACD} = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

In the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle C = 90^\circ \), \( AB = 13 \), and \( AC = 5 \). Points \( D \) and \( E \) are the midpoints of \( AC \) and \( AB \) respectively. Find the length of \( DE \).

2. Solution:
To find the length of \( DE \), we can use the properties of midpoints and the Pythagorean theorem.

First, we need to find the length of \( BC \). Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \]
\[ 13^2 = 5^2 + BC^2 \]
\[ 169 = 25 + BC^2 \]
\[ BC^2 = 144 \]
\[ BC = 12 \]

Now, we know:
- \( AC = 5 \)
- \( BC = 12 \)
- \( AB = 13 \)

Since \( D \) is the midpoint of \( AC \), the length \( AD \) is:
\[ AD = \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \]

Since \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), the length \( AE \) is:
\[ AE = \frac{AB}{2} = \frac{13}{2} = 6.5 \]

To find \( DE \), we can use the midpoint theorem, which states that the segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half as long. In this case, \( DE \) is parallel to \( BC \) and half its length:
\[ DE = \frac{BC}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

2. Solution:
Given:
- \( AB = 8 \)
- \( MN = 2 \)
- \( N \) is the midpoint of \( BC \)
- \( AM \) is the angle bisector of \( \angle BAC \)
- \( BM \perp AM \)

Since \( N \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), we have \( BN = NC \).

Let \( AC = x \).

Since \( AM \) is the angle bisector of \( \angle BAC \), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[ \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{BM}{MC} \]

Given \( AB = 8 \) and let \( AC = x \), we have:
\[ \frac{8}{x} = \frac{BM}{MC} \]

Since \( BM \perp AM \), \( BM \) and \( MC \) form a right triangle with \( MN \) as the median to the hypotenuse. In a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, \( MN = \frac{BC}{2} \).

Given \( MN = 2 \), we have:
\[ \frac{BC}{2} = 2 \]
\[ BC = 4 \]

Since \( N \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), we have:
\[ BN = NC = \frac{BC}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, using the Angle Bisector Theorem:
\[ \frac{8}{x} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

Thus:

   Given that line \( AB \) is tangent to circle \( O \) at point \( A \), with \( AB = 8 \) and \( OB = 10 \), find the diameter of the circle.

2. **Solution:**
   - Since \( AB \) is tangent to the circle at point \( A \), \( OA \) is perpendicular to \( AB \). Therefore, \( \triangle OAB \) is a right triangle with \( \angle OAB = 90^\circ \).
   - In right triangle \( OAB \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     OB^2 = OA^2 + AB^2
     \]
   - Given \( OB = 10 \) and \( AB = 8 \), we substitute these values into the equation:
     \[
     10^2 = OA^2 + 8^2
     \]
     \[
     100 = OA^2 + 64
     \]
   - Solving for \( OA^2 \):
     \[
     OA^2 = 100 - 64
     \]
     \[
     OA^2 = 36

   Find the distance from the center \( O \) of a circle with radius 5.0 units to the chord \( AB \) which has a length of 8.0 units.

2. **Solution:**
   To find the distance from the center \( O \) to the chord \( AB \), we can use the following steps:

   - Let \( d \) be the distance from the center \( O \) to the chord \( AB \).
   - The radius of the circle is \( r = 5.0 \) units.
   - The length of the chord \( AB \) is \( 8.0 \) units.

   The perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the chord bisects the chord. Therefore, we can form a right triangle where:
   - The hypotenuse is the radius of the circle, \( r = 5.0 \) units.
   - One leg is half the length of the chord, \( \frac{AB}{2} = \frac{8.0}{2} = 4.0 \) units.
   - The other leg is the distance from the center to the chord, \( d \).

   Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle:

     x + x + 50^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     2x + 50^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     2x = 130^\circ
     \]
     \[
     x = 65^\circ
     \]
   - Therefore, \(\angle PAB = \angle PBA = 65^\circ\).

GPT4OMiniModel,273,"One diagonal of a rhombus is twice as long as the other diagonal. If the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters, what are the lengths of the diagonals?",26,"1. **Problem:**
   Find the lengths of the diagonals of a rhombus given that one diagonal is twice as long as the other and the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters.

2. **Solution:**
   Let the length of the shorter diagonal be \( x \) millimeters. Then, the length of the longer diagonal is \( 2x \) millimeters.

   The area \( A \) of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
   \]
   where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

   Given:
   \[
   A = 169 \text{ square millimeters}
   \]
   \[
   d_1 = x \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   \[
   d_2 = 2x \text{ millimeters}
   \]

   Substitute the values into the area formula:
   \[
   169 = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times 2x
   \]

   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   169 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2x^2
   \]
   \[
   169 = x^2
   \]

   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x^2 = 169
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{169}
   \]
   \[
   x = 13 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

   Therefore, the lengths of the diagonals are:
   \[
   d_1 = x = 13 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   \[
   d_2 = 2x = 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. **Answer:**
   The lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus are 13 millimeters and 26 millimeters.",1,7.240071058273315,371,436

Given a circle with center \( O \) and radius \( 2 \), points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on the circle. The angle \( \angle C = 30^\circ \). We need to find the length of chord \( AB \).

2. Solution:
To find the length of chord \( AB \), we can use the following steps:

- Since \( \angle C = 30^\circ \) and \( O \) is the center of the circle, the central angle \( \angle AOB \) subtended by chord \( AB \) is twice the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \). Therefore, \( \angle AOB = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ \).

- In the triangle \( \triangle AOB \), \( OA \) and \( OB \) are radii of the circle, so \( OA = OB = 2 \).

- We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of \( AB \):
  \[
  AB^2 = OA^2 + OB^2 - 2 \cdot OA \cdot OB \cdot \cos(\angle AOB)
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  AB^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \cos(60^\circ)

If ∠CC′B′ = 32.0, then the size of ∠AC′B′ is ()",13°,"1. **Problem:**
   In the given right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \), the triangle is rotated clockwise around point \( A \) by \( 90^\circ \) to obtain \( \triangle AB'C' \). The corresponding points are \( B' \) and \( C' \). Given that \( \angle CC'B' = 32^\circ \), find the measure of \( \angle AC'B' \).

2. **Solution:**
   - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is rotated \( 90^\circ \) clockwise around point \( A \), the right angle \( \angle BAC \) remains at point \( A \) but the positions of points \( B \) and \( C \) change to \( B' \) and \( C' \) respectively.
   - After the rotation, \( \angle BAC \) becomes \( \angle B'AC' \), which is still \( 90^\circ \).
   - Given \( \angle CC'B' = 32^\circ \), we need to find \( \angle AC'B' \).

   Since \( \angle B'AC' = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle CC'B' = 32^\circ \), we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

   In \( \triangle AC'B' \):
   \[
   \angle AC'B' + \angle B'AC' + \angle AB'C' = 180^\circ
   \]
   We know \( \angle B'AC' = 90^\circ \). Let \( \angle AC'B' = x \).

   Therefore:
   \[
   x + 90^\circ + \angle AB'C' = 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   x + \angle AB'C' = 90^\circ
   \]

   Now, consider \( \triangle CC'B' \):
   \[
   \angle CC'B' + \angle C'B'C + \angle B'CC' = 180^\circ
   \]
   Given \( \angle CC'B' = 32^\circ \) and \( \angle B'CC' = 90^\circ \) (since \( \triangle ABC \) was a right triangle and the rotation preserves the right angle at \( A \)):
   \[
   32^\circ + \angle C'B'C + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \angle C'B'C = 58^\circ
   \]

   Since \( \angle AB'C' \) is the same as \( \angle C'B'C \) (because \( B' \) and \( C' \) are corresponding points after rotation):
   \[
   \angle AB'C' = 58^\circ
   \]

   Substituting back into our earlier equation:
   \[
   x + 58^\circ = 90^\circ

   \[
   x = 90^\circ - 58^\circ = 32^\circ

2. **解决方案**:
   - 首先，设∠FBD = 2α，则∠FBE = ∠EBD = α（因为BE平分∠FBD）。
   - 由于CE平分∠ACD，设∠ACD = 2β，则∠ACE = ∠ECD = β。
   - 在△BEC中，已知∠BEC = 35°，则∠EBC + ∠ECB = 145°（因为三角形内角和为180°）。
   - 由于∠EBC = α，∠ECB = β，所以α + β = 145°。
   - 在△FAE中，∠FAE = ∠FAD - ∠EAD。
   - 由于∠FAD = ∠FBD = 2α，∠EAD = ∠EAC + ∠CAD = β + α（因为CE平分∠ACD）。
   - 所以∠FAE = 2α - (β + α) = α - β。
   - 由α + β = 145°，可得α = 145° - β。
   - 将α = 145° - β代入∠FAE = α - β中，得∠FAE = (145° - β) - β = 145° - 2β。
   - 由于∠ACD = 2β，且∠ACD是内角，所以2β < 180°，即β < 90°。
   - 由此可知，∠FAE = 145° - 2β是一个锐角。

   To solve this problem, we need to use the property of circles that states the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle that subtends the same arc.

   - The inscribed angle ∠ACB subtends the arc AB.
   - The central angle ∠AOB also subtends the same arc AB.

   Determine the area of triangle \( \triangle AFK \) given that the area of triangle \( \triangle DFH \) is 10. The figure is composed of 25 small congruent equilateral triangles.

2. **Solution:**
   - The large triangle \( \triangle AFK \) is composed of 25 small congruent equilateral triangles.
   - The triangle \( \triangle DFH \) is composed of 5 small congruent equilateral triangles.

   Find the measure of angle \( \angle K \) in the given isosceles trapezoid \( JKLM \) where \( JM \parallel KL \), \( JM = KL \), and \( \angle M = 80^\circ \).

2. **Solution:**
   In an isosceles trapezoid, the non-parallel sides (legs) are equal in length, and the base angles are equal. Here, \( JM \parallel KL \) and \( JM = KL \).

   Given:
   - \( \angle M = 80^\circ \)
   - \( JM \parallel KL \)
   - \( JM = KL \)
   - \( MJ = KL = 6 \)

   Since \( JM \parallel KL \), the consecutive interior angles on the same side of the transversal \( ML \) are supplementary. Therefore, \( \angle M + \angle L = 180^\circ \).

   \[
   \angle M + \angle L = 180^\circ
   \]
   \[
   80^\circ + \angle L = 180^\circ
   \]
   \[
   \angle L = 180^\circ - 80^\circ = 100^\circ
   \]

   Since \( JKLM \) is an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. Therefore, \( \angle J = \angle K \).

   Also, the sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \). Thus,
   \[
   \angle J + \angle K + \angle M + \angle L = 360^\circ
   \]
   \[
   \angle J + \angle K + 80^\circ + 100^\circ = 360^\circ

   \[
   \angle J + \angle K + 180^\circ = 360^\circ

   \[
   \angle J + \angle K = 360^\circ - 180^\circ = 180^\circ

2. **Solution:**
   In any quadrilateral, the sum of the interior angles is \( 360^\circ \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the sum of the angles in quadrilateral \( ABCD \) as:
   \[
   \angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 360^\circ
   \]

   Given:
   \[
   \angle B = 90^\circ, \quad \angle C = 90^\circ, \quad \angle D = x^\circ, \quad \angle A = 3x^\circ
   \]

   Substitute these values into the equation:
   \[
   3x^\circ + 90^\circ + 90^\circ + x^\circ = 360^\circ
   \]

   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3x + 90 + 90 + x = 360

To solve this problem, we need to use properties of circles and angles.

- \( \angle C \) is an inscribed angle that subtends arc \( AB \).
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

Let \( \angle AOB \) be the central angle subtending arc \( AB \).

Since \( \angle C \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \( AB \):
\[ \angle C = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOB \]

Given \( \angle C = 35^\circ \):
\[ 35^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOB \]

Solving for \( \angle AOB \):
\[ \angle AOB = 2 \times 35^\circ = 70^\circ \]

   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle ABC + \angle ADC = 180^\circ \).

   Given:
   \[
   \angle ABC = 60^\circ
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   \angle ADC = 180^\circ - \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ
   \]

   - Now, consider the exterior angle \( \angle CDE \). The exterior angle of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the interior opposite angle.

   Therefore:
   \[
   \angle CDE = \angle ADC = 120^\circ
   \]

GPT4OMiniModel,375,Find the length of $AC$ in the isosceles triangle ABC. ,7,"1. **Problem:**
   Find the length of \( AC \) in the isosceles triangle \( ABC \) where \( AB = 9x - 1 \), \( AC = 4x + 1 \), and \( BC = 5x - 0.5 \).

2. **Solution:**
   Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles, two sides must be equal. We need to determine which sides are equal.

   Let's assume \( AC = BC \) (since the markings indicate these sides are equal):
   \[
   4x + 1 = 5x - 0.5
   \]

   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   4x + 1 = 5x - 0.5
   \]
   \[
   1 + 0.5 = 5x - 4x
   \]
   \[

   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 1.5 \) back into the expression for \( AC \):
   \[
   AC = 4x + 1
   \]
   \[
   AC = 4(1.5) + 1

In the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \), equilateral triangles \( \triangle A'BC \), \( \triangle AB'C \), and \( \triangle ABC' \) are constructed outwardly on the sides \( BC \), \( AC \), and \( AB \) respectively. Given that the areas of \( \triangle A'BC \) and \( \triangle AB'C \) are 10 and 4 respectively, find the area of \( \triangle ABC' \).

2. Solution:
Let's denote the lengths of the sides of \( \triangle ABC \) as follows:
- \( AB = c \)
- \( AC = b \)
- \( BC = a \)

Since \( \triangle A'BC \) and \( \triangle AB'C \) are equilateral triangles, their areas can be expressed in terms of the side lengths \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.

The area \( A \) of an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]

For \( \triangle A'BC \):
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 = 10 \]
\[ a^2 = \frac{40}{\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ a^2 = \frac{40\sqrt{3}}{3} \]

For \( \triangle AB'C \):
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} b^2 = 4 \]
\[ b^2 = \frac{16}{\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ b^2 = \frac{16\sqrt{3}}{3} \]

Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( c \):
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \]
\[ c^2 = \frac{40\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{16\sqrt{3}}{3} \]
\[ c^2 = \frac{56\sqrt{3}}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the area of \( \triangle ABC' \). Since \( \triangle ABC' \) is an equilateral triangle with side length \( c \), its area is:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC' = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} c^2 \]
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC' = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot \frac{56\sqrt{3}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC' = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot \frac{56\sqrt{3}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC' = \frac{56 \cdot 3}{12} \]
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC' = 14 \]

2. Solution:
To find \( \angle F \), we need to use the properties of the circle and the given angles.

- Since \( AB \) is the diameter, \( \angle AOB = 180^\circ \).
- \( \angle AOF = 40^\circ \) is given.
- \( \angle AOF \) is a central angle, and the arc \( AF \) subtended by this angle is \( 40^\circ \).

   Given a circle \(\odot O\) with diameter \(CD\) crossing the midpoint \(G\) of chord \(EF\), and \(\angle DCF = 20^\circ\), find \(\angle EOD\).

2. **Solution:**
   To find \(\angle EOD\), we can use properties of circles and angles subtended by chords and diameters.

   - Since \(CD\) is the diameter, \(\angle CED\) and \(\angle CFD\) are right angles (90°) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is a right angle.
   - Given \(\angle DCF = 20^\circ\), we can find \(\angle ECF\) because \(\angle ECF\) is the exterior angle for \(\triangle CDF\).

   \[
   \angle ECF = \angle DCF + \angle CDF = 20^\circ + 90^\circ = 110^\circ
   \]

   - Since \(G\) is the midpoint of \(EF\), \(EG = GF\). Therefore, \(\triangle EGF\) is isosceles with \(EG = GF\).
   - The central angle \(\angle EOF\) subtended by chord \(EF\) is twice the inscribed angle \(\angle ECF\) (by the Inscribed Angle Theorem).

   \[
   \angle EOF = 2 \times \angle ECF = 2 \times 110^\circ = 220^\circ

   - However, \(\angle EOF\) is a reflex angle, and we need the smaller angle \(\angle EOD\).

   Given that quadrilateral \(ABDC\) is a rectangle and \(m\angle 1 = 38^\circ\), find \(m\angle 2\).

2. **Solution:**
   In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. This means that the diagonals divide the rectangle into two congruent triangles. 

   Since \(ABDC\) is a rectangle, the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(O\), and they bisect each other. Therefore, \(\triangle AOB\) and \(\triangle COD\) are congruent, and \(\triangle AOD\) and \(\triangle BOC\) are congruent.

   Given \(m\angle 1 = 38^\circ\), we need to find \(m\angle 2\).

   Notice that \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are alternate interior angles formed by the transversal \(AC\) intersecting the parallel lines \(AB\) and \(CD\). In a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel, so \(AB \parallel CD\).

   Since \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are alternate interior angles, they are equal. Therefore, \(m\angle 2 = m\angle 1\).

   Find the measure of a central angle in the circle \(\odot K\) where the square \(ABDC\) is inscribed.

2. **Solution:**
   To find the measure of a central angle in the circle, we need to understand the relationship between the square and the circle.

   - Since \(ABDC\) is a square inscribed in the circle, the vertices of the square lie on the circumference of the circle.
   - The diagonals of the square intersect at the center of the circle, \(K\), and are equal to the diameter of the circle.
   - The diagonals of the square also bisect each other at right angles (90 degrees).

   Let's denote the side length of the square as \(s\). The diagonal of the square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{s^2 + s^2} = \sqrt{2s^2} = s\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Since the diagonal of the square is also the diameter of the circle, we have:
   \[
   \text{Diameter of the circle} = s\sqrt{2}
   \]

   The central angle subtended by one side of the square can be found by considering the fact that the square divides the circle into four equal arcs. Each arc corresponds to a central angle.

   The total angle around a point (the center of the circle) is \(360^\circ\). Since the square divides the circle into four equal parts, each central angle is:
   \[
   \text{Central angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ

In triangle \( \triangle ABC \), \( AD \) bisects \( \angle BAC \) and intersects \( BC \) at point \( D \). \( DE \) is perpendicular to \( AB \) with foot \( E \). Given \( DE = 3 \) and \( AC = 4 \), find the area of \( \triangle ADC \).

2. Solution:
To find the area of \( \triangle ADC \), we need to determine the base \( DC \) and the height from \( A \) to \( DC \).

Since \( AD \) is the angle bisector, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that \( \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} \). However, we do not have enough information about \( AB \) and \( BC \) directly. Instead, we can use the given height \( DE \) and the length \( AC \).

Given:
- \( DE = 3 \)
- \( AC = 4 \)

Since \( DE \) is perpendicular to \( AB \), \( DE \) is the height of \( \triangle ADE \) from \( D \) to \( AB \).

The area of \( \triangle ADE \) can be calculated using:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ADE = \frac{1}{2} \times DE \times AB \]

However, we need the area of \( \triangle ADC \). Notice that \( \triangle ADE \) and \( \triangle ADC \) share the same height from \( A \) to \( DC \), which is \( DE \).

The area of \( \triangle ADC \) can be calculated using:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times DE \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 3 \]

GPT4OMiniModel,30,"As shown in the figure, the two chords AB and CD in the circle intersect at E, ∠D = 35.0, ∠AEC = 105.0, then ∠C = ()",70°,"1. **Problem:**
   Given a circle with chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting at point \(E\). The angles \(\angle D = 35.0^\circ\) and \(\angle AEC = 105.0^\circ\) are provided. We need to find the measure of \(\angle C\).

2. **Solution:**
   To find \(\angle C\), we can use the properties of the circle and the intersecting chords.

   - First, note that \(\angle AEC\) is the external angle for \(\triangle CED\) and \(\triangle AEB\).
   - The external angle \(\angle AEC\) is equal to the sum of the opposite internal angles \(\angle CED\) and \(\angle EAB\).

   Since \(\angle AEC = 105.0^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   \angle AEC = \angle CED + \angle EAB
   \]
   Given that \(\angle D = 35.0^\circ\), we know that \(\angle CED\) is an external angle for \(\triangle CED\), and it is equal to the sum of the opposite internal angles \(\angle C\) and \(\angle EDC\).

   Since \(\angle D = 35.0^\circ\), we have:
   \[
   \angle CED = \angle C + \angle EDC
   \]
   But \(\angle EDC\) is the same as \(\angle D\) because they are vertically opposite angles, so:
   \[
   \angle CED = \angle C + 35.0^\circ
   \]

   Now, substituting back into the equation for \(\angle AEC\):
   \[
   105.0^\circ = \angle C + 35.0^\circ + \angle EAB
   \]

   Since \(\angle EAB\) is the same as \(\angle C\) because they are vertically opposite angles, we can simplify:
   \[
   105.0^\circ = \angle C + 35.0^\circ + \angle C
   \]
   \[
   105.0^\circ = 2\angle C + 35.0^\circ
   \]

   Solving for \(\angle C\):
   \[
   105.0^\circ - 35.0^\circ = 2\angle C
   \]
   \[
   70.0^\circ = 2\angle C
   \]
   \[
   \angle C = 35.0^\circ

GPT4OMiniModel,816,"Find x. Round to the nearest tenth, if necessary.",3,"1. Problem: 
Find the value of \( x \) in the given geometric figure, where a triangle and a circle intersect. The lengths of the segments are given as \( x \), \( 9 \), \( 2x \), \( y \), \( 24 \), and \( 12.25 \).

2. Solution:
To solve for \( x \), we can use the Power of a Point theorem, which states that for a point outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the two segments from the point to the circle is equal. 

In this case, the point outside the circle is the point where the segments \( x \) and \( 9 \) meet, and the point where the segments \( 2x \) and \( y \) meet.

According to the Power of a Point theorem:
\[ (x + 9) \cdot 9 = (2x + y) \cdot y \]

We also know that:
\[ y = 24 \]
\[ 2x + y = 12.25 \]

First, solve for \( y \):
\[ 2x + y = 12.25 \]
\[ y = 12.25 - 2x \]

Now substitute \( y = 12.25 - 2x \) into the Power of a Point equation:
\[ (x + 9) \cdot 9 = (2x + (12.25 - 2x)) \cdot (12.25 - 2x) \]
\[ (x + 9) \cdot 9 = 12.25 \cdot (12.25 - 2x) \]

Simplify and solve for \( x \):
\[ 9x + 81 = 12.25 \cdot 12.25 - 24.5x \]
\[ 9x + 81 = 150.0625 - 24.5x \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 9x + 24.5x = 150.0625 - 81 \]
\[ 33.5x = 69.0625 \]

Divide both sides by 33.5:
\[ x = \frac{69.0625}{33.5} \]

   Given a circle with center \( O \) and points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) on the circumference such that \( \angle ACB = 25^\circ \). We need to find the measure of \( \angle BAO \).

2. **Solution:**
   To solve this problem, we will use the properties of circles and angles subtended by the same arc.

   - Since \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are points on the circumference of the circle, \( \angle ACB \) is an inscribed angle.
   - The inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \) subtends the arc \( AB \).
   - The central angle \( \angle AOB \) subtending the same arc \( AB \) is twice the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \).

   Therefore, we have:

   \angle AOB = 2 \times \angle ACB = 2 \times 25^\circ = 50^\circ
   \]

   - Now, we need to find \( \angle BAO \). Notice that \( \angle BAO \) is half of \( \angle AOB \) because \( O \) is the center of the circle and \( \angle BAO \) is one of the angles formed by the radius \( OA \) and the chord \( AB \).

   Therefore:

2. **Solution:**
   - Since \(AB\) is the diameter of the circle, \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\) (angle in a semicircle).
   - The tangent at point \(C\) is perpendicular to the radius \(OC\), so \(\angle OCB = 90^\circ\).
   - \(\angle A = 25^\circ\) is given, which is the angle between the tangent at \(C\) and the line \(AD\).
   - Since \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\), \(\angle DCB = 90^\circ - \angle A = 90^\circ - 25^\circ = 65^\circ\).
   - \(\angle D\) is the exterior angle for \(\triangle DCB\), which is equal to the sum of the opposite interior angles \(\angle ACB\) and \(\angle DCB\).

   - Since \(D\) is the midpoint of \(CE\), \(CD = DE = \frac{CE}{2} = \frac{13.5}{2} = 6.75\).
   - \(BD\) is the perpendicular distance from the center \(B\) to the chord \(CE\).
   - In the right triangle \(BCD\), \(BC\) is the hypotenuse, and \(BD\) and \(CD\) are the legs.
   - The radius \(BC\) is equal to \(8\) (since \(B\) is the center and \(C\) is on the circle).
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle BCD\):
     \[
     BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     8^2 = BD^2 + 6.75^2

   - The measure of the arc \(AB\) subtended by the central angle \(\angle AOB\) is equal to the measure of \(\angle AOB\), which is \(40^\circ\).

Given a rhombus \(ABCD\) with \(E\) and \(F\) being the midpoints of sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) respectively, and given \(AB = 5\) and \(AC = 6\), find the length of \(EF\).

2. Solution:
To find the length of \(EF\), we can use the properties of the rhombus and the coordinates of the points.

First, let's place the rhombus in the coordinate plane with \(A\) at the origin \((0, 0)\), \(B\) at \((5, 0)\), \(D\) at \((0, 5)\), and \(C\) at \((5, 5)\).

Since \(E\) and \(F\) are midpoints:
- \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AB\), so its coordinates are \(\left(\frac{5}{2}, 0\right)\).
- \(F\) is the midpoint of \(AD\), so its coordinates are \(\left(0, \frac{5}{2}\right)\).

Now, we need to find the distance between \(E\) and \(F\). The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Substituting the coordinates of \(E\) and \(F\):
\[
EF = \sqrt{\left(0 - \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{5}{2} - 0\right)^2}
\]
\[
EF = \sqrt{\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2}

\[
EF = \sqrt{\frac{25}{4} + \frac{25}{4}}

GPT4OMiniModel,615,"If two sides of a triangle measure 12 and 7, which of the following cannot be the perimeter of the triangle?",38,"To determine which of the given perimeters cannot be the perimeter of the triangle, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

Given:
- Side \( a = 12 \)
- Side \( b = 7 \)
- Let \( c \) be the third side

The triangle inequality theorem gives us three conditions:
1. \( a + b > c \)
2. \( a + c > b \)
3. \( b + c > a \)

Substituting the given values:
1. \( 12 + 7 > c \) ⟹ \( 19 > c \) ⟹ \( c < 19 \)
2. \( 12 + c > 7 \) ⟹ \( c > -5 \) ⟹ \( c > 0 \) (since side lengths are positive)
3. \( 7 + c > 12 \) ⟹ \( c > 5 \)

Combining these inequalities, we get:
\[ 5 < c < 19 \]

Now, let's consider the possible perimeters. The perimeter \( P \) of the triangle is given by:
\[ P = a + b + c = 12 + 7 + c = 19 + c \]

Since \( 5 < c < 19 \), the possible range for \( c \) is from just above 5 to just below 19. Therefore, the possible range for the perimeter \( P \) is:
\[ 19 + 5 < P < 19 + 19 \]
\[ 24 < P < 38 \]

So, the perimeter of the triangle must be between 24 and 38 (exclusive).

Any value outside this range cannot be the perimeter of the triangle. For example, if the options were 20, 25, 30, and 40, the value that cannot be the perimeter is 20 and 40, as they fall outside the range of 24 to 38.

Therefore, the perimeters that cannot be the perimeter of the triangle are 20 and 40.",0,7.096267938613892,526,454
GPT4OMiniModel,674,"In the figure above, CDE is an equilateral triangle and ABCE is a square with an area of 1. What is the perimeter of polygon ABCDE?",5,"1. **Problem:**
   Determine the perimeter of polygon ABCDE, where CDE is an equilateral triangle and ABCE is a square with an area of 1.

2. **Solution:**
   - First, find the side length of the square ABCE.
     Since the area of the square is 1, the side length \( s \) of the square is:
     \[
     s^2 = 1 \implies s = \sqrt{1} = 1
     \]
     Therefore, each side of the square ABCE is 1 unit.

   - Next, determine the side length of the equilateral triangle CDE.
     Since CDE is an equilateral triangle and one of its sides (CE) is also a side of the square, the side length of the equilateral triangle is also 1 unit.

   - Calculate the perimeter of polygon ABCDE.
     The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all its sides:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = AB + BC + CD + DE + EA
     \]
     Since AB, BC, and EA are sides of the square, each is 1 unit. CD and DE are sides of the equilateral triangle, each also 1 unit.
     \[

2. Solution:
   - First, we know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can find the sum of \( \angle B \) and \( \angle C \):
     \[
     \angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ
     \]
     Given \( \angle A = 110^\circ \):
     \[
     110^\circ + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     \angle B + \angle C = 70^\circ
     \]

   - The internal angle bisectors of \( \angle B \) and \( \angle C \) intersect at point \( O \). The angle formed by these bisectors, \( \angle BOC \), can be found using the angle bisector theorem. The measure of \( \angle BOC \) is given by:
     \[
     \angle BOC = 180^\circ - \frac{1}{2} \angle A
     \]
     Substituting \( \angle A = 110^\circ \):
     \[
     \angle BOC = 180^\circ - \frac{1}{2} \times 110^\circ

2. Solution:
   - Since \(\triangle ABC\) is a right triangle and \(\angle C = 90^\circ\), we can find \(\angle A\) using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\):
     \[
     \angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     \angle A + 58^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     \angle A = 180^\circ - 148^\circ = 32^\circ
     \]

   - Since \(a \parallel b\), \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle B\) are corresponding angles, so:
     \[
     \angle 1 = \angle B = 58^\circ

   Given a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersecting at point \(O\), where \(AC = 12.0\), \(BD = 8.0\), and \(AB = 7.0\). Find the perimeter of triangle \(OAB\).

2. **Solution:**
   In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, point \(O\) is the midpoint of both diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

   - Since \(O\) is the midpoint of \(AC\), \(AO = \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{12.0}{2} = 6.0\).
   - Since \(O\) is the midpoint of \(BD\), \(BO = \frac{BD}{2} = \frac{8.0}{2} = 4.0\).

2. **Solution:**
   To minimize the perimeter of \(\triangle AMN\), we need to use the concept of reflection and the properties of geometric figures.

   - Reflect point \(A\) across line \(BC\) to get point \(A'\).
   - Reflect point \(A\) across line \(CD\) to get point \(A''\).

   The shortest path from \(A\) to line segments \(BC\) and \(CD\) will be a straight line passing through these reflections.

   - The line segment \(A'A''\) will intersect \(BC\) at point \(M\) and \(CD\) at point \(N\).

   Since \(A'\) and \(A''\) are reflections, the angles formed at \(M\) and \(N\) will be symmetrical.

   - \(\angle BAM = \angle A'MA\)
   - \(\angle DAN = \angle A''NA\)

   **Step 1: Solve for \( x \)**
   \[

   Combine like terms:
   \[

GPT4OMiniModel,566,如图，已知△ABC≌△DEF，CD平分∠BCA，若∠A＝22°，∠CGF＝88°，则∠E的度数是（）,26°,"1. Problem: Given that △ABC ≌ △DEF, CD bisects ∠BCA, ∠A = 22°, and ∠CGF = 88°, find the measure of ∠E.

2. Solution:
   - Since △ABC ≌ △DEF, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, ∠A = ∠D, ∠B = ∠E, and ∠C = ∠F.
   - Given ∠A = 22°, we have ∠D = 22°.
   - In △ABC, the sum of the interior angles is 180°. Thus, we can find ∠B and ∠C:
     \[
     ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
     \]
     \[
     22° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
     \]
     \[
     ∠B + ∠C = 158°
     \]
   - Since CD bisects ∠BCA, ∠BCD = ∠DCA. Let ∠BCD = ∠DCA = x. Therefore, ∠BCA = 2x.
   - We know that ∠CGF = 88°. Since CD bisects ∠BCA, ∠BCG = ∠GCA = x.
   - In △CGF, the sum of the interior angles is 180°. Thus:
     \[
     ∠BCG + ∠GCA + ∠CGF = 180°
     \]
     \[
     x + x + 88° = 180°
     \]
     \[
     2x + 88° = 180°
     \]
     \[
     2x = 92°
     \]
     \[
     x = 46°

   - Therefore, ∠BCA = 2x = 92°.
   - Now, we can find ∠B:

     \[
     ∠B = 158° - 92°

     ∠E = 66°

2. Solution:
   - Since \(AB\) is the diameter of the circle, \(\angle ACB\) is a right angle (90°) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is a right angle.
   - \(\angle BCD\) is given as 25°.
   - We need to find \(\angle AOD\).

   To find \(\angle AOD\), we can use the property of the circle that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at any point on the circumference.

   - \(\angle BCD\) subtends arc \(BD\).
   - Therefore, the central angle \(\angle BOD\) subtended by arc \(BD\) is twice \(\angle BCD\).

   \[
   \angle BOD = 2 \times \angle BCD = 2 \times 25^\circ = 50^\circ
   \]

   - Since \(AB\) is the diameter, \(\angle AOD\) is a straight angle that includes \(\angle BOD\).

   \[
   \angle AOD = 180^\circ - \angle BOD = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ

   Given that ∠BAC = 110.0°, and points A and B are symmetrical with respect to the line MP, and points A and C are symmetrical with respect to the line NQ, determine the size of ∠PAQ.

2. **Solution:**
   - Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to the line MP, MP is the perpendicular bisector of segment AB. Therefore, ∠BAP = ∠MAP.
   - Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to the line NQ, NQ is the perpendicular bisector of segment AC. Therefore, ∠CAQ = ∠NAQ.
   - Given that ∠BAC = 110.0°, we need to find the angles ∠BAP and ∠CAQ.

   Let's denote:
   - ∠BAP = x
   - ∠CAQ = y

   Since MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB, ∠BAP = ∠MAP = x.
   Since NQ is the perpendicular bisector of AC, ∠CAQ = ∠NAQ = y.

   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   x + y = 110.0°
   \]

   Now, we need to find the size of ∠PAQ. Since ∠PAQ is the angle between the lines MP and NQ, and MP and NQ are the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC respectively, the angle between these lines is half of the angle ∠BAC.

   Given that \(\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}\), find the value of \(x\) in the circle with the given angles.

2. **Solution:**
   Since \(\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}\), the angles subtended by these chords at the center of the circle are equal. Therefore, the angle \(\angle CHJ\) is equal to the angle \(\angle KJH\).

   The angle \(\angle GJH\) is given as \(83^\circ\), and the angle \(\angle KJH\) is given as \((2x - 27)^\circ\).

   Since \(\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}\), the angles subtended by these chords at the circumference of the circle are equal. Therefore, the angle \(\angle GJH\) is equal to the angle \(\angle KJH\).

2. Solution:
   - Since \( l_1 \parallel l_2 \), the corresponding angles formed by a transversal are equal.
   - The right triangle has angles of 90°, 30°, and 60°.
   - The angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) on the right triangle is 60° (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180° and the right angle is 90°).
   - Therefore, the angle on the triangle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) is 60°.
   - Since \( \angle 1 = 76° \), the angle on the same line but on the other side of the transversal (which is \( \angle 2 \)) must be supplementary to the sum of 76° and 60°.

   Find the value of \( x \) given the angles in the diagram. Assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent.

2. **Solution:**
   - The angle formed outside the circle by two tangents is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.
   - The intercepted arcs are \( (4x + 50)^\circ \) and the arc opposite to it, which is \( 360^\circ - (4x + 50)^\circ \).

   The formula for the angle formed outside the circle by two tangents is:
   \[
   \text{Exterior Angle} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{Major Arc} - \text{Minor Arc} \right)
   \]

   Here, the exterior angle is \( 30^\circ \) and the minor arc is \( (4x + 50)^\circ \). The major arc is:
   \[
   360^\circ - (4x + 50)^\circ = 310^\circ - 4x
   \]

   Plugging these into the formula:
   \[
   30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \left( (310^\circ - 4x) - (4x + 50)^\circ \right)
   \]

   Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \left( 310^\circ - 4x - 4x - 50^\circ \right)
   \]
   \[
   30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \left( 260^\circ - 8x \right)

   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[

   Determine the y-coordinate of the center of mass of an isosceles right triangle of uniform areal density, with legs of length \(a\), as shown in Figure 9-C.

2. **Solution:**
   To find the y-coordinate of the center of mass (\( \bar{y} \)) of the isosceles right triangle, we can use the formula for the centroid of a triangle. For a triangle with vertices at \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\), the coordinates of the centroid (\( \bar{x}, \bar{y} \)) are given by:

GPT4OMiniModel,252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"To find the resistance between terminals \( a \) and \( b \) in the infinitely long chain of resistors where \( R = 1 \), we can use the concept of infinite series and symmetry.

### Problem:
Determine the equivalent resistance \( R_{eq} \) between terminals \( a \) and \( b \) in an infinitely long chain of resistors, where each resistor has a resistance \( R = 1 \).

### Solution:
1. **Assume the Equivalent Resistance:**
   Let \( R_{eq} \) be the equivalent resistance between terminals \( a \) and \( b \). Because the chain is infinite, the resistance looking into the network from any point will be the same. 

2. **Redraw the Network:**
   Consider the first section of the network. The first section consists of:
   - One resistor \( R \) in series with the parallel combination of:
     - One resistor \( R \)
     - The rest of the infinite network (which has resistance \( R_{eq} \))

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The equivalent resistance \( R_{eq} \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   R_{eq} = R + \left( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{R_{eq}}} \right)
   \]
   Simplify the parallel combination:
   \[
   \frac{1}{R_{eq} - R} = \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{R_{eq}}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{R_{eq} - R} = \frac{R_{eq} + R}{R \cdot R_{eq}}
   \]
   \[
   R_{eq} - R = \frac{R \cdot R_{eq}}{R_{eq} + R}
   \]
   Multiply both sides by \( R_{eq} + R \):
   \[
   (R_{eq} - R)(R_{eq} + R) = R \cdot R_{eq}
   \]
   \[
   R_{eq}^2 - R^2 = R \cdot R_{eq}
   \]
   Rearrange the equation:
   \[
   R_{eq}^2 - R \cdot R_{eq} - R^2 = 0
   \]

4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -R \), and \( c = -R^2 \):
   \[
   R_{eq}^2 - R \cdot R_{eq} - R^2 = 0
   \]
   Use the quadratic formula \( R_{eq} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
   \[
   R_{eq} = \frac{R \pm \sqrt{R^2 + 4R^2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   R_{eq} = \frac{R \pm \sqrt{5R^2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   R_{eq} = \frac{R \pm R\sqrt{5}}{2}
   \]
   Since resistance cannot be negative, we take the positive root:
   \[
   R_{eq} = \frac{R(1 + \sqrt{5})}{2}
   \]

5. **Substitute \( R = 1 \):**
   \[
   R_{eq} = \frac{1(1 + \sqrt{5})}{2}
   \]
   \[
   R_{eq} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
   \]

### Answer:
The equivalent resistance between terminals \( a \) and \( b \) is:
\[
R_{eq} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}

Given that rectangle ABCD is subdivided into two identical square regions, and the area of each square is 9, determine the perimeter of rectangle ABCD.

2. Solution:
To find the perimeter of rectangle ABCD, we need to determine its length and width.

Step 1: Determine the side length of each square.
- The area of each square is given as 9.
- The area of a square is calculated as side length squared.
  \[
  \text{side length}^2 = 9
  \]
  \[
  \text{side length} = \sqrt{9} = 3
  \]

Step 2: Determine the dimensions of rectangle ABCD.
- Since the rectangle is subdivided into two identical squares, the width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square, which is 3.
- The length of the rectangle is equal to the combined side lengths of the two squares, which is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Step 3: Calculate the perimeter of rectangle ABCD.
- The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})

Given that \( AB \parallel CD \), \( AF \) intersects \( CD \) at point \( E \), \( BE \perp AF \), and \( \angle B = 65^\circ \). Find the measure of \( \angle DEF \).

2. Solution:
To find \( \angle DEF \), we need to use the given information and properties of parallel lines and angles.

- Since \( AB \parallel CD \) and \( AF \) is a transversal, the corresponding angles \( \angle BAF \) and \( \angle AFE \) are equal. Therefore, \( \angle BAF = \angle AFE = 65^\circ \).

- Given \( BE \perp AF \), \( \angle AFE = 90^\circ \).

- In triangle \( AFE \), the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can find \( \angle EAF \):
  \[
  \angle EAF = 180^\circ - \angle AFE - \angle BAF = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 65^\circ = 25^\circ
  \]

- Since \( \angle EAF = 25^\circ \) and \( AF \) is a straight line, \( \angle DEF \) is supplementary to \( \angle EAF \). Therefore:
  \[
  \angle DEF = 180^\circ - \angle EAF = 180^\circ - 25^\circ = 155^\circ

GPT4OMiniModel,815,Find $m \angle N C L$,120,"1. **Problem:**
   Find the measure of angle \( \angle NCL \) in the given circle diagram.

2. **Solution:**
   To find \( m \angle NCL \), we need to use the fact that the sum of the angles around point \( C \) is \( 360^\circ \).

   The angles around point \( C \) are:
   - \( \angle RCM = (x - 1)^\circ \)
   - \( \angle MCL = (3x + 5)^\circ \)
   - \( \angle MCN = 60^\circ \)
   - \( \angle NCL \) (which we need to find)

   The sum of these angles is:
   \[
   (x - 1) + (3x + 5) + 60 + m \angle NCL = 360

   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   x - 1 + 3x + 5 + 60 + m \angle NCL = 360
   \]
   \[
   4x + 64 + m \angle NCL = 360
   \]

   Solving for \( m \angle NCL \):
   \[
   m \angle NCL = 360 - 4x - 64
   \]
   \[
   m \angle NCL = 296 - 4x
   \]

   To find the value of \( x \), we need to use the fact that the sum of the angles around point \( C \) is \( 360^\circ \). We can set up the equation:
   \[
   (x - 1) + (3x + 5) + 60 + (296 - 4x) = 360
   \]

   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   x - 1 + 3x + 5 + 60 + 296 - 4x = 360

   Find the value of \( x \) given the angles \( 3x^\circ \) and \( (5x - 12)^\circ \) in the cyclic quadrilateral \( CDE \) inscribed in a circle.

2. **Solution:**
   In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to \( 180^\circ \). Here, the angles \( 3x^\circ \) and \( (5x - 12)^\circ \) are opposite angles.

   Therefore, we can write the equation:

and $m \angle WZG=20,$ find $m \angle YIZ$",50,"1. **Problem:**
   Given the following conditions:
   \[
   \frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ}, \quad m \angle WXJ = 130^\circ, \quad m \angle WZG = 20^\circ,
   \]
   find \( m \angle YIZ \).

2. **Solution:**
   To find \( m \angle YIZ \), we need to analyze the given geometric relationships and angles.

   - First, note that \( m \angle WXJ = 130^\circ \) is an exterior angle to \( \triangle XJY \). Therefore, the interior angle \( \angle JXY \) is:
     \[
     m \angle JXY = 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ.
     \]

   - Next, consider \( m \angle WZG = 20^\circ \). Since \( W, X, Y, Z \) are collinear and \( \angle WZG \) is an exterior angle to \( \triangle YIZ \), we can find the interior angle \( \angle YZI \):
     \[
     m \angle YZI = 180^\circ - 20^\circ = 160^\circ.
     \]

   - Now, we need to find \( m \angle YIZ \). Notice that \( \angle YIZ \) is an interior angle of \( \triangle YIZ \). To find this angle, we need to use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

   - We already have \( m \angle YZI = 160^\circ \). We need to find the other two angles in \( \triangle YIZ \).

   - Since \( \frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ} \), triangles \( \triangle IJX \) and \( \triangle HJY \) are similar by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) similarity criterion. This implies that corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, \( \angle IJX = \angle HJY \).

   - Let \( \angle IJX = \angle HJY = \theta \). Since \( \angle JXY = 50^\circ \), we have:
     \[
     \theta + 50^\circ = 180^\circ - \angle JYX.
     \]

   - Solving for \( \angle JYX \):
     \[
     \angle JYX = 180^\circ - (\theta + 50^\circ) = 130^\circ - \theta.
     \]

   - Now, consider \( \triangle YIZ \). We have:
     \[
     m \angle YIZ + m \angle IZY + m \angle ZYI = 180^\circ.
     \]

   - We know \( m \angle IZY = 160^\circ \) and \( m \angle ZYI = \theta \). Therefore:
     \[
     m \angle YIZ + 160^\circ + \theta = 180^\circ.
     \]

   - Solving for \( m \angle YIZ \):
     \[
     m \angle YIZ = 180^\circ - 160^\circ - \theta = 20^\circ - \theta.
     \]

   - Since \( \theta \) is an angle in the triangle, it must be positive. However, we need to find the exact value of \( \theta \) to determine \( m \angle YIZ \).

   - Given the similarity and the angles, we can deduce that \( \theta \) must be such that the angles sum up correctly. Since \( \theta \) is not explicitly given, we assume it to be \( 0^\circ \) for simplicity, leading to:
     \[
     m \angle YIZ = 20^\circ.

   Given the degree measures of minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\) as \(x\) and major arc \(\widehat{ADC}\) as \(y\), and the measure of \(\angle ABC = 70^\circ\), find the value of \(x\).

2. **Solution:**
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
   - \(\angle ABC\) intercepts the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\).

   Given a circle \( O \) with diameter \( AB \), and tangents \( DB \) and \( DC \) at points \( B \) and \( C \) respectively. If \( \angle ACE = 25^\circ \), find the measure of \( \angle D \).

2. **Solution:**
   - Since \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle, \( \angle ACB \) is a right angle (90°) because the angle subtended by the diameter in a semicircle is a right angle.
   - Given \( \angle ACE = 25^\circ \), we need to find \( \angle D \).

   Let's denote the points and angles as follows:
   - \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \)
   - \( \angle ACE = 25^\circ \)
   - \( \angle D \) is the angle we need to find.

   Since \( DB \) and \( DC \) are tangents to the circle at points \( B \) and \( C \) respectively, the angles between the tangents and the radii at the points of tangency are right angles. Therefore:
   - \( \angle DBC = 90^\circ \)
   - \( \angle DCB = 90^\circ \)

   Now, consider the quadrilateral \( DBCO \):
   - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \).
   - We have two right angles at \( B \) and \( C \), so:
     \[
     \angle DBC + \angle DCB = 90^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]

   Therefore, the remaining two angles \( \angle BDO \) and \( \angle CDO \) must sum to \( 180^\circ \):
   \[
   \angle BDO + \angle CDO = 180^\circ
   \]

   Since \( \angle BDO \) and \( \angle CDO \) are the same angle (as they are both angles at point \( D \) formed by the tangents), we can denote them as \( \angle D \):
   \[
   2 \angle D = 180^\circ

   \angle D = 90^\circ

   Find the angle ∠CTD in the given square ABCD, where CT is tangent to the semicircle centered at A with diameter AD.

2. **Solution:**
   - Since ABCD is a square, all its angles are 90 degrees.
   - The semicircle is centered at A with diameter AD, so the radius of the semicircle is half the length of AD.
   - The tangent to a circle (or semicircle) at any point is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
   - Therefore, CT is perpendicular to AT.
   - Since AT is a radius of the semicircle and CT is tangent at T, ∠ATC = 90 degrees.
   - In the right triangle ATD, angle ∠ATD is 90 degrees because AD is the diameter of the semicircle.
   - Since CT is tangent to the semicircle at T, and AT is the radius, ∠ATC = 90 degrees.
   - In triangle ATD, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. We have:
     \[
     \angle ATD + \angle TAD + \angle TDA = 180^\circ
     \]
     Given that ∠ATD = 90 degrees, we have:
     \[
     90^\circ + \angle TAD + \angle TDA = 180^\circ
     \]
     Therefore:
     \[
     \angle TAD + \angle TDA = 90^\circ
     \]
   - Since AD is a straight line, ∠TAD = ∠TDA = 45 degrees.
   - Now, considering the right triangle ATD, we know that ∠ATC = 90 degrees and ∠TAD = 45 degrees.
   - Therefore, ∠CTD is the remaining angle in the right triangle ATD:

Find the value of \( x \) to the nearest tenth, given that the segments that appear to be tangent are tangent. The lengths of the segments are as follows: one segment inside the circle is 15, another segment inside the circle is 12, and the external segment is 8.

2. Solution:
To solve this problem, we can use the Power of a Point theorem, which states that for a point outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the two segments from the point to the circle is equal. Specifically, if a point \( P \) outside the circle has two tangents \( PA \) and \( PB \) to the circle, then \( PA^2 = PB \cdot PC \), where \( PB \) and \( PC \) are the segments from the point to the points of tangency.

In this problem, we have:
- \( PA = x \) (the external segment)
- \( PB = 8 \) (the external segment)
- \( PC = 15 + 12 = 27 \) (the sum of the internal segments)

According to the Power of a Point theorem:
\[ PA^2 = PB \cdot PC \]
\[ x^2 = 8 \cdot 27 \]
\[ x^2 = 216 \]

To find \( x \), we take the square root of both sides:
\[ x = \sqrt{216} \]
\[ x \approx 14.7 \]

2. **Solution:**

   Given a circle \(\odot S\) with \(m \widehat{PQR} = 98^\circ\), find the measure of the arc \(PQ\).

2. **Solution:**
   To find the measure of the arc \(PQ\), we need to understand the relationship between the central angle and the arc it intercepts.

   - The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that intercepts the arc.
   - In this problem, \(m \widehat{PQR} = 98^\circ\) is given as the measure of the angle at \(Q\), which is an inscribed angle.
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

   Therefore, if \(m \widehat{PQR} = 98^\circ\), then the measure of the intercepted arc \(PR\) is:
   \[
   m \widehat{PR} = 2 \times m \widehat{PQR} = 2 \times 98^\circ = 196^\circ
   \]

   Since \(PQ\) and \(QR\) are parts of the circle, and \(PR\) is the entire arc intercepted by the inscribed angle \(PQR\), we need to find the measure of the arc \(PQ\).

   - The total measure of the circle is \(360^\circ\).
   - The measure of the arc \(QR\) is the remaining part of the circle after subtracting the measure of the arc \(PR\).

   Therefore, the measure of the arc \(PQ\) is:
   \[

GPT4OMiniModel,930,如图，F是△ABC的角平分线CD和BE的交点，CG⊥AB于点G．若∠ACG＝32°，则∠BFC的度数是（）,119°,"1. Problem:
Given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with angle bisectors \( CD \) and \( BE \) intersecting at point \( F \). \( CG \) is perpendicular to \( AB \) at point \( G \). Given \( \angle ACG = 32^\circ \), find the measure of \( \angle BFC \).

2. Solution:
To find \( \angle BFC \), we need to use the properties of angle bisectors and the given angles.

- Since \( CG \) is perpendicular to \( AB \), \( \angle CGA = 90^\circ \).
- Given \( \angle ACG = 32^\circ \), we can find \( \angle BCG \) because \( \angle ACG + \angle BCG = 90^\circ \) (since \( CG \) is perpendicular to \( AB \)).

\[
\angle BCG = 90^\circ - \angle ACG = 90^\circ - 32^\circ = 58^\circ
\]

- Since \( CD \) and \( BE \) are angle bisectors, \( F \) is the incenter of \( \triangle ABC \). The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of a triangle intersect, and it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.
- The measure of \( \angle BFC \) can be found using the fact that the incenter divides the angles of the triangle into two equal parts.

\[
\angle BFC = 90^\circ + \frac{1}{2} \angle ACB
\]

- To find \( \angle ACB \), we use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

\[
\angle ACB = 180^\circ - \angle BAC - \angle ABC
\]

- Since \( \angle ACG = 32^\circ \) and \( \angle BCG = 58^\circ \), we can find \( \angle ACB \).

\[
\angle ACB = 32^\circ + 58^\circ = 90^\circ
\]

- Now, we can find \( \angle BFC \).

\[
\angle BFC = 90^\circ + \frac{1}{2} \times 90^\circ = 90^\circ + 45^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

3. Answer:
\[
\angle BFC = 135^\circ

GPT4OMiniModel,955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"1. Problem: Determine the measure of angle ∠ADE in the given regular pentagon ABCDE with center O and circumscribed circle ⊙O.

2. Solution:
   - In a regular pentagon, each interior angle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
     \[
     \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(5-2) \times 180^\circ}{5} = \frac{3 \times 180^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ
     \]

   - The central angle subtended by each side of the pentagon is:
     \[
     \text{Central angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
     \]

   - Since O is the center of the circumscribed circle, the line segments OA, OB, OC, OD, and OE are all radii of the circle and are equal in length.

   - In triangle OAD, since OA = OD (both are radii), triangle OAD is isosceles. The angle at the center (∠AOD) is 2 times the angle at the circumference (∠ADE) subtended by the same arc AD.

   - The central angle ∠AOD is:
     \[
     \text{Central angle} \, \angle AOD = 2 \times \angle ADE
     \]

   - Since ∠AOD is the sum of two central angles (∠AOB and ∠BOD), each of which is 72°:
     \[
     \angle AOD = 72^\circ + 72^\circ = 144^\circ
     \]

   - Therefore, ∠ADE is half of ∠AOD:
     \[
     \angle ADE = \frac{144^\circ}{2} = 72^\circ
     \]

3. Answer: The measure of angle ∠ADE is \( 72^\circ \).",0,7.174760818481445,366,463
GPT4OMiniModel,304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"1. **Problem:**
   Given that two line segments meet at a point on line \( l \), and the angles formed are \( x^\circ \), \( y^\circ \), and \( 70^\circ \). If the value of \( y \) is equal to the square of the value of \( x \), find the value of \( y \).

2. **Solution:**
   - Since the angles on a straight line sum up to \( 180^\circ \), we can write the equation:
     \[
     x + y + 70 = 180
     \]
   - Simplify the equation to find the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \):
     \[
     x + y = 110
     \]
   - Given that \( y = x^2 \), substitute \( y \) in the equation:
     \[
     x + x^2 = 110
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     x^2 + x - 110 = 0
     \]
   - Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -110 \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-110)}}{2 \cdot 1}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 440}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{441}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-1 \pm 21}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two possible solutions for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-22}{2} = -11
     \]
   - Since \( x \) represents an angle, it must be positive, so \( x = 10 \).

   - Now, substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the equation \( y = x^2 \):
     \[
     y = 10^2 = 100
     \]

3. **Answer:**
   The value of \( y \) is \( 100 \).",1,8.84156084060669,370,535
